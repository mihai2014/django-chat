-------------------------------------------------------------

The ChatConsumer that we have written is currently synchronous. Synchronous consumers are convenient because they can call regular synchronous I/O functions such as those that access Django models without writing special code. However asynchronous consumers can provide a higher level of performance since they donâ€™t need to create additional threads when handling requests.

ChatConsumer only uses async-native libraries (Channels and the channel layer) and in particular it does not access synchronous Django models. Therefore it can be rewritten to be asynchronous without complications.
